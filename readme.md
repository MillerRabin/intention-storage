# Intention Storage
This is a core package for Intention Network. It gives ability for the device
to be a member of such networks.
It`s include code to accept intentions, searching for counter intentions and translate
intentions to another storages. 

## What is Intention Network
With Intention Network you can build communication systems between you 
and your devices. It can be your smart house or field communication system.
+ **No proprietary devices** There is no need to buy devices with specific vendor interfaces,
every common electronic device can be used. Simple devices with simple controllers can do
complex things together.
+ **Full autonomous** There is no need to be connected to the internet, intention network 
can works in full autonomous mode.
+ **High scalability** Not only a house, but yard, workshop, robo-cafe, robo-market,
everything can work full autonomous.
+ **Full area control** Then you use online assistance, you control nothing. 
You just send a commands to the cloud from station. And the cloud will decide
how it will be done. The cloud controls rules, not you. With intention network you
can communicate with your device directly. The cloud is not necessary.
+ **Not a toy** The smart house systems which depending on internet connectivity
is nothing more than expensive toys. When a real fire or robbery starts that systems 
becomes useless first. With intention network you can build a system that will resists
a real threats.
+ **Fail safe** Every life important nodes and communications lines 
can be easily doubled, tripled and more without synchronisation problems.
