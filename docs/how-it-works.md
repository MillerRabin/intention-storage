#How Intention Network works
When the device needs to get something or give something, that device generates an intention and 
broadcasts it through known storages to searching an intention for counter needs.
When that intention is found, then the devices starts to communicate with each other.
The device can generate a lot of intentions and get answers from many devices.
They forms an intention network. This makes it possible for simple devices to do
a complex things together.

##What is Intention
Generally, intention is a JSON structure. It can be generated from device to begin 
communication and broadcasted to network. The gestures and speech can also generate 
the intentions. It gives ability to user interact with intentions in most 
friendly ways.
